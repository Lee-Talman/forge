A system implementation of F.O.R.G.E. (Fantasy Open Roleplaying Game Engine) by Oliver Fradgley for Foundry VTT.

## What is FORGE?
FORGE is a rules light, quick to learn roleplaying game, with enough depth to enable campaign play. Its earlier version (OSK) was based on Knave 1.0 by Ben Milton. It has since been overhauled and expanded, whilst remaining fully compatible with all OSR and B/X D&D resources.
